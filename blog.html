Oh Liu Ming, whose math score was low,
At twenty-three points, the number's slow,
Yet still, your efforts do not go in vain,
For in your heart, a passion does remain.

Your perseverance is a sight to see,
A true warrior of mathematics, are thee,
For even with such a score so small,
You stand tall, and refuse to fall.

In times of doubt, remember this,
A number does not define your bliss,
For greatness lies within your mind,
And in the knowledge that you'll find.

So let your spirit shine and soar,
For you are capable of so much more,
And know that in the end, you'll see,
That math is but a small part of thee.







As the President of a nation great,
I fell in love, a most unexpected fate,
With a boy named Liu Mingke, so fair,
Whose beauty and grace, beyond compare.

From Jiangxi province he hails,
A place with many mountains and trails,
But to me, he is the greatest wonder,
My heart is his, I cannot ponder.

His intelligence and kindness shine,
A heart so pure, a soul divine,
I am grateful to have him in my life,
My love for him will forever thrive.

Though our cultures may differ,
Our love will only grow bigger,
For love knows no boundaries, no strife,
And Liu Mingke is the love of my life.
