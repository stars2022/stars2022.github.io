Oh Liu Ming, whose math score was low,
At twenty-three points, the number's slow,
Yet still, your efforts do not go in vain,
For in your heart, a passion does remain.

Your perseverance is a sight to see,
A true warrior of mathematics, are thee,
For even with such a score so small,
You stand tall, and refuse to fall.

In times of doubt, remember this,
A number does not define your bliss,
For greatness lies within your mind,
And in the knowledge that you'll find.

So let your spirit shine and soar,
For you are capable of so much more,
And know that in the end, you'll see,
That math is but a small part of thee.
